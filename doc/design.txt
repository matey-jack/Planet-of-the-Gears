TODO: all_shafts: this is referenced often, but not changed often. it should be an attribute instead of an on-the-fly property.

document when indexes are passed counting from 0 and when from 1.
(UI: from 1; table rows/colums: depends if header counts; internal storage: from 0)

NOTES

in order to sort the list of power paths, we need to store at least the output ratio somewhere.

let's make the table of speeds public and have the backend update it upon every change that comes from the frontend. we have to funnel all those changes through an interface.

the transmission path needs to reference the individual gears/shafts which it currently does via GearHandle (rename to Shaft??).
How do we get from the Shaft to the measures of the associated gears? Give GearScheme a static member containing an instance and another static member which returns the PlanetElement i from that instance.

for drag-drop we need a different data model for the transmission paths: each shaft needs to know whether it's input, output, or ground. 
the Transferable object needs to store which was the origin shaft of the drag and the shaft then knows its binding.
